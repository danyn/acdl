        <p>While full cast crowns and bridges offer a variety of metal options, gold is still the preferred choice for many
            doctors because of its durability, function, and marginal integrity. The gold technicians at Creative Dental
            Laboratories are specially trained in all aspects of tooth form and function. We offer gold content options from
            52% to 96% and type II to type IV, depending on the requirements of each particular situation. We also offer
            white semi precious restorations. Our gold technicians will ensure that every restoration meets the highest quality
            standard you expect.

    <p>Oral implantology remains one of the most dynamic fields within dentistry. This is due in large to the development of
        safe, effective implant systems. We produce implant based crown & bridge using both Nobel Biocare and Straumann systems.
        By using both metal and zirconia abutments we are able to consistently produce high quality restorations with excellent
        aesthetics that match the original dentition. Fixed and screw retained single or bridge restorations.</p>
