    We are a small dental laboratory that offers our clients a unique, comfortable dental experience.  By specializing in crown & bridge we are able to offer exceptional quality and consistency not found in most large laboratories. We have become highly proficient in porcelain, veneer, implant, gold, E.max and zirconia restorations.

    We know many of your patients are unhappy with appearance and function of old dental work â€“ while others are embarrassed by misaligned teeth. We provide fast turnaround on diagnostic wax-ups so those patients who are unsure can really see what a dental restoration can do for them.  Whatever their motivation, we are always happy to accommodate you.
